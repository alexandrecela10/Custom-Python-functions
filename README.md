# Custom-functions
Automated EDA, Data Processing, Model Analysis

This readme file presents a set of custom functions that automate key aspects of a machine learning (ML) project, including Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Preprocessing (Label/One-Hot Encoding/Scaling), and Model Analysis. These functions aim to streamline and facilitate the ML workflow, providing efficient and consistent processes for these important tasks.
